<h2>About</h2>
<p>The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
	recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when
	Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
	Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
	Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
	action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
	leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

		<h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
		<p>
			In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely
			Mountain. Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the
			dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated
			when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies
			beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree
			branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even
			in death.

				<h3>Fili and Killi</h3>
				<p>
					Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also
					nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing
					feature was his long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.</p>

				<h3>Óin</h3>
				<p>Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. He usually wore a
					brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin
					Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely
					Mountain wearing a brown hood. Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with
					them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing
					the fire for the Company. He fought in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies, and later settled
					in the Lonely Mountain along with many other dwarves of The Company of Thorin.</p>

						<h3>Gloin</h3>
						<p>Glóin was born in TA 2783, after Erebor, after the Dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the
							younger child of Gróin and younger brother of Óin.

							In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of
							the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown what significance he did, being 16
							years old.

							In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an
							unknown wife. In March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard
							Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to reclaim Erebor, so that Smaug wouldn't start an alliance
							with Sauron, when Gandalf mentioned hobbits, Glóin referred them as "simpletons" and also
							said that hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling distance of the nakedest
							dragonet new from the shell".</p>

						<h3>Balin</h3>
						<p>Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a
							younger brother named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug
							attacked the Lonely Mountain. Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before
							fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar.
							Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin,
							when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and
							lost.</p>

								<h3>Dwalin</h3>
								<p>Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin was
									the son of Fundin and younger brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of
									Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied Thrain the Second and Thorin
									Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.

									Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others accompanied
									Thráin when he left the Ered Luin to visit Erebor. The small party was dogged by the
									emissaries of Sauron. In TA 2845, Thráin was captured one night when he and his
									companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood from a black rain. After a
									fruitless search for their leader, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin to
									inform him the news.</p>

								<h3>Bifur</h3>
								<p>Whilst he was a descendant of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, Bifur was not of Durin's Folk. Most of his familial relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He and his family were driven out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the Dragon Smaug, and were forced to live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a new life in the Blue Mountains, he continued his life as a toy maker.</p>

						<h3>Bofur</h3>
						<p>Bofur's heritage is unclear, but he was not of Durin's Folk. He and his family hailed from the Blue Mountains. As such, they felt less strongly about the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug, more interested in the adventure than a home they'd never seen.</p>

								<h3>Bombur</h3>
								<p>Bombur's parentage is unknown. He is the brother of Bofur and cousin of Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's line, although he was descended from the Dwarves of Moria. His birth date is unknown, though it fell somewhere between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the thirteen "by some fifty years," and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.</p>

						<h3>Gandalf</h3>
						<p>Gandalf (Norse; IPA: [gand:alf] - "Elf of the Wand" or "Wand-elf") the Grey, later known as Gandalf the White, and originally named Olórin (Quenya; IPA: [oˈloːrin] - "Dreamer" or "Of Dreams"), was an Istar (Wizard), sent to Middle-earth in the Third Age to combat the threat of Sauron. He joined Thorin and his company to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from Smaug, convoked the Fellowship of the Ring to destroy the One Ring, and led the Free Peoples in the final campaign of the War of the Ring.</p>
